### Mission

The **Global Open Series in Environmental Economics** (GoSee) unites researchers, policymakers, and other key actors around the world to propose, discuss, and ultimately solve key environmental and economic issues.

<br>

We hope that this series breaks down many traditional barriersâ€”across institutions, nations, classes, _etc._ All are welcome.

<br>

You can submit an abstract [here]() or simply join the mailing list [here]().
